# Contribute to make it a wordle-solver instead of just a helper
- Let the AI play it , train it to reduce the no. of tries it requires to get to the word
- Rank the words on the basis of popularity in English ?
- Remove previous words that have already been done 
- could we use regex here ?

# want to play more than just one word a day ?
